[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       In  the  1st  form,  create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.  In the 3rd and 4th forms, create
       links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.  Create hard links by default, symbolic links with [1m--symbolic[22m.  By default, each destination (name of new link) should not  already  ex‚Äê
       ist.   When creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links can hold arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link is interpreted in relation to its par‚Äê
       ent directory.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       [1m--backup[22m[=[4mCONTROL[24m]

       [1m--version[0m
              output version information and exit

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with [1m--suffix [22mor SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the [1m--backup [22moption or through the VERSION_CON‚Äê
       TROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if [1m--backup [22mis given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       Using [1m-s [22mignores [1m-L [22mand [1m-P[22m.  Otherwise, the last option specified controls behavior when a TARGET is a symbolic link, defaulting to [1m-P[22m.
